Of course. This is a crucial final step. Before diving into the technical weeds of a single component, everyone involved must understand the "map" of the entire system. This high-level overview serves as that map, providing the strategic context for the PRD and the technical plan.

Here is the broad-stroke overview of the entire federated agent system.

### **System Architecture Overview: The Federated Knowledge Mesh**

#### **1. The Vision: A Council of Specialists**

Our goal is not to build a single, all-knowing AI "oracle." Instead, we are building a **Federated Knowledge Mesh**: a decentralized ecosystem of independent, highly specialized AI agents that collaborate to solve complex software engineering tasks.

Think of it as a "council of specialists" for a codebase. When faced with a complex problem, you don't ask one generalist; you consult a team: an architect, a historian, a semantic expert, and a quality assurance engineer. Our system will do the same. Each agent is a microservice with its own "brain" (its database, logic, and dependencies), completely isolated from the others. An **Orchestrator** will act as the "general contractor," querying the council to formulate a comprehensive solution.

#### **2. The Core Problem This Solves: Avoiding the Monolith**

Past projects have demonstrated a critical flaw: as more capabilities are added (semantic search, structural analysis, git history), they become a **convoluted monolith**. This leads to dependency conflicts, a fragile codebase, and a system that is impossible to maintain or scale.

The Federated Knowledge Mesh is the direct architectural solution to this problem. By design, it prevents a monolith from ever forming.

#### **3. Architectural Principles**

The entire system is built on three core software architecture principles:

1.  **Microservices:** Each agent is a small, independent service with a single responsibility.
2.  **API-First:** Agents communicate exclusively through well-defined RESTful APIs. There is no direct code-level integration, preventing "spaghetti code."
3.  **Containerization:** Every agent is packaged as a Docker container, making them portable, scalable, and ensuring their dependencies are completely isolated.

#### **4. The Council of Specialists: The Agents**

This is the roster of specialized agents we plan to build over time. Each one is a separate project.

- **Agent 1: `agent-semantic-code` (The Meaning Expert)**
  - **Purpose:** Understands the _semantic meaning_ and conceptual similarity of code.
  - **Technology:** Ollama Embeddings (`nomic-embed-text`) + Qdrant Vector Database.
  - **Key API Endpoints:** `/search`, `/repos`. Answers questions like: "Show me code related to JWT authentication."

- **Agent 2: `agent-structural` (The Architect)**
  - **Purpose:** Understands the _structure_ and _connections_ within the code.
  - **Technology:** Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) parsing (`tree-sitter`) + Neo4j Graph Database.
  - **Key API Endpoints:** `/get_call_graph`, `/get_dependencies`. Answers questions like: "What functions call `calculate_user_permissions`?" or "What services will break if I change this class?"

- **Agent 3: `agent-time-travel` (The Historian)**
  - **Purpose:** Understands the _evolution_ of the codebase over time.
  - **Technology:** `GitPython` to analyze commit history, branches, and blame data.
  - **Key API Endpoints:** `/get_commit_history`, `/who_wrote_this_line`. Answers questions like: "Show me the last 5 people who touched this file and why," or "When was this logic introduced?"

- **Agent 4: `agent-code-execution` (The Sandbox)**
  - **Purpose:** Safely executes code, runs tests, and performs linting to validate changes.
  - **Technology:** A sandboxed Docker environment (`docker-py`) that can execute commands and capture output.
  - **Key API Endpoints:** `/execute_test`, `/lint_code`. Answers questions like: "Does the proposed code change pass all unit tests?"

#### **5. The Orchestrator: The Conductor of the Symphony**

The Orchestrator is the intelligence layer that uses the council. It does not perform analysis itself.

- **Role:** Takes a high-level user goal (e.g., "Refactor the authentication flow").
- **Process:**
  1.  **Deconstructs the Goal:** Breaks the problem down into a series of smaller questions.
  2.  **Queries the Mesh:** Sends targeted API requests to the appropriate specialist agents.
  3.  **Synthesizes Context:** Gathers the semantic, structural, and historical context from the agents.
  4.  **Generates Solutions:** Passes this rich, multi-modal context to a powerful LLM (like a local Qwen2.5 or DeepSeek-Coder model via Ollama) to generate a final plan, code change, or report.
- **Implementation:** We will likely use **LangGraph** for its ability to create complex, stateful agentic workflows in Python.

#### **6. The Phased Rollout Plan**

We will build this system incrementally, ensuring each phase delivers a valuable, standalone component.

1.  **Phase 1: Forge the `agent-semantic-code`** (This is our current focus). Deliver a robust, containerized semantic search API.
2.  **Phase 2: Build the `agent-structural`**. Deliver a containerized code graph analysis API.
3.  **Phase 3: Develop the first Orchestrator Workflow**. Create a simple LangGraph agent that uses the first two agents to perform a task (e.g., automated code documentation).
4.  **Phase 4 and Beyond:** Develop the remaining agents (`time-travel`, `code-execution`) and build increasingly sophisticated orchestration workflows.

This strategic overview provides the "why" behind our technical decisions. It ensures that as we build `agent-semantic-code`, we are doing so with a clear understanding of its role in a much larger, more powerful system, effectively preventing the blunders of the past.
